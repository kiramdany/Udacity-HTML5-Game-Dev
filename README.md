###Exercises from the udacity course HTML5 game development
---

I'm using visual studio for it's helpful features to complete the exercises from the course. 
Using the intellisense so that I can quickly work out the correct syntax and the methods of objects.
Running webpages in browser and debugging with firebug.

The methodology is to write working code using the visual studio aids and checking in the browser. Then redoing exercises on Udacity site to reinforce learning.

>The built in git feature is not great so there will be a few dodgy commits! 
My idea was to have a branch for each section of the course and commit after every exercise. Then I would merge with 
master and push to github so that the public commits were a bit cleaner and easier to follow. However it seems that merge
using the VS git tool merges all previous commits from the branch.

I am now running git from command line which is much better

    - Buttons in index.html execute the code written from the corresponding exercise
    - For most these, this just writes a message to console to test that the code is working.

- Canvas 
    - Buttons mainly load images
    - Multiple clicks of buttons will load mutiple copies of image
    - Code slightly altered from exercises so that links are valid, page is more presentable etc.
