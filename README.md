# Udacity-HTML5-Game-Dev
Exercises from the udacity course HTML5 game development


I'm using visual studio for it's helpful features to complete the exercises from the course. 
Using the intellisense I can quickly work out the correct syntax and the methods of objects.

The built in git feature is not great so there will be a few dodgy commits! 
My idea was to have a branch for each section of the course and commit after every exercise. Then I would merge with 
master and push to github so that the public commits were a bit cleaner and easier to follow. However it seems that merge
using the VS git tool merges all previous commits from the branch.

I may set up git from the console to manage further commits

Sections:
- Optional Javascript Crash Course
    - Buttons in index.html execute the code written from the corresponding exercise
    - For most these, this just writes a message to console to test that the code is working.

- Canvas
